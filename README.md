# LocationFinder-Mapping-Your-World

LocationFinder is a web application that fetches a user's geolocation using the Geolocation API, saves the coordinates in localStorage, and displays the location on a map. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and integrates with Google Maps to show the user's location.

This repository contains the source code for the web application, including an HTML file with a button to fetch the user's geolocation and a div to display the map, a JavaScript file to handle the geolocation and map integration, and a CSS file to style the HTML elements.

# Key features of this project include:

Get Location Functionality: users can fetch their geolocation by clicking a button, and the coordinates are saved in localStorage for future use.

Use of localStorage: the application uses localStorage to store and retrieve the user's latitude and longitude coordinates.

showPosition Function: a callback function is called to retrieve the user's latitude and longitude coordinates from the Geolocation API, and then saves them to localStorage.

Remove Location: users can click a button to remove their saved location from localStorage.

Showing lat,long on Google Maps: the application integrates with Google Maps to display the user's location on a map.
